# Physical Pacman

Physical Pacman is an in-progress project meant to create a clone of the classic Pacman game, which runs on a board powered by electromagnets. Once we reach the finish line, more comprehensive documentation will be provided.

In the project files you will find the materials needed to create your own physical Pacman clone, as well as a coil winding machine.
To complete the project you will have to either print and build the coil winding machine, or use an existing one.

If you do attempt to wind the required 230+ coils manually, please send us a video :)

Using our machine, it would take approx 11-15 hours to wind all the coils once you are proficient at operating the machine.

Project ToDo:
* Get 100% of relays connected.
* Add code to toggle shift-register/pin mixed output and map it to board.
* Integration testing and fine tuning.
